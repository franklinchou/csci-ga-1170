# Problem 1

Sort the array A = [19, 2, 11, 14, 7, 17, 4, 3, 5, 15] using heap sort.

1. After initial heapify:

[19, 15, 17, 14, 7, 11, 4, 3, 5, 2]

2. After each call to MaxHeapify:

Iteration | Resulting array
--- | ---
1 | [17, 15, 11, 14, 7, 2, 4, 3, 5, 19]
2 | [15, 14, 11, 5, 7, 2, 4, 3, 17, 19]
3 | [14, 7, 11, 5, 3, 2, 4, 15, 17, 19]
4 | [11, 7, 4, 5, 3, 2, 14, 15, 17, 19]
5 | [7, 5, 4, 2, 3, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19]
6 | [5, 3, 4, 2, 7, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19]
7 | [4, 3, 2, 5, 7, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19]
8 | [3, 2, 4, 5, 7, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19]
9 | [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11, 14, 15, 17, 19]
