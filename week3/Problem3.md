# Problem 3

Sort the array A = [392, 517, 364, 931, 726, 912, 299, 250, 600, 185] using Radix Sort.

Radix Sort sorts based on the number of digits of the elements in the array. An array containing 4 digit numbers will have 4 intermediate steps. This array will be sorted in three steps:

Iteration | Resulting Array
--- | ---
1 | [250, 600, 931, 392, 912, 364, 185, 726, 517, 299]
2 | [600, 912, 517, 726, 931, 250, 364, 185, 392, 299]
3 | [185, 250, 299, 364, 392, 517, 600, 726, 912, 931]
