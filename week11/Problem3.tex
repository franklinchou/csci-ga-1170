\maketitle


The multiplicative rule of probability states that to find the probability of the intersection of 
two independent events multiply them together. Here, since each event is independent, the probability
that a certain route will not fail is the product of each segment of the route not failing or the 
product of the probability of each edge not failing. In other words, $\forall (u, v) \in E$, find path, 
$u \xrightarrow{p} v : \max \prod r(u, v) $.


To accomplish this, extract the maximum from the queue (rather than the minimum since Dijkstra is minimizing path
length) and modify the $\textrm{relax}$ function to maximize products rather than sums, e.g.,

$$\textrm{relax}(u, v) = 
    (v.d, v.\pi) := (u.d * w(u, v)), u) \textrm{ if } v.d < u.d * w(u, v) 
$$
